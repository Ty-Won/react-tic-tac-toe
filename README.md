# react-tutorial
## Hey there!

This is the first react app that I built! It's based off the tutorial given on the official react website located here 
[Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). It covers some of the main components of react such as components, states and props!

### Ensure you have nodeJS installed (You should get a version number if it is installed correctly)
```javascript
npm -v
```

### To setup the project run
```javascript
npm install
```
What this command does is that it takes all the modules that I have used to make the project and installs them automatically for you!


### To run the project
```javascript
npm start
```

This will start a local host server that will display the contents of the app!
